<p class="highlight">Looking for love online?</p>

<p class="paragraph">Follow one lonely, divorced man as he tries to do just that. These are the true stories of the women he meets on his journey. Each story is told in a matter-of-fact manner style and entirely from his perspective. Some readers may be offended by his descriptions of the women he meets and his feelings towards them.</p>

<p class="paragraph">This book is, however, more about failure than it is about success, and in that sense could be considered 'amusing' in an 'glad it wasn't me sort of way'. It's NOT a book about getting chicks or macking women. Quite the opposite.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Although it's not a "how-to" book you'll still probably learn many things you shouldn't do when dating women you meet online. You'll learn some things that do work successfully, but overall you'll get a realistic picture of the online dating scene, and it's not always pretty.</p>

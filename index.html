<p class="highlight">Looking for love online?</p>

<p class="paragraph">Follow one lonely, divorced man as he tries to find love online. These are the true stories of the women he meets on his journey. Each story is told in a matter-of-fact manner style and entirely from his perspective.</p>

<p class="paragraph">This book is more about failure than it is about success. It's NOT a book about getting chicks or macking women successfully. Quite the opposite. In this book you'll see one man's (at times) humorous and (at other times)sad attempts to find love.</p>

<p class="paragraph">You'll learn many things you shouldn't do when dating online. You'll learn some things that do work successfully, but overall you'll get a realistic picture of the online dating scene, and it's not pretty'.</p>
